# India-Census-SQL-Project

Dataset's are taken from the following websites,

Dataset1 : https://www.census2011.co.in/district.php
Dataset2 : https://www.census2011.co.in/literacy.php

The Indian census is one of the largest and most extensive surveys conducted in the world. The data collected from this survey is used for a wide range of purposes, from public policy making to academic research. In this project, we will explore the data collected in the Indian census, focusing on population, growth, sex ratio, and literacy rates.

The data for this project is available in two datasets - one state-wise and the other district-wise. The state-wise dataset contains information about the population, growth rate, sex ratio, and literacy rate of each state in India. The district-wise dataset contains similar information but at a more granular level, i.e., for each district in India.

To analyze and explore this data, we will use SQL, a powerful programming language designed for managing and manipulating large datasets. Using SQL, we will extract and transform the data to gain insights into the population trends in India.

First, we will load the data into a SQL database and create a schema that matches the structure of the datasets. Then we will write SQL queries to explore the data, starting with simple queries such as selecting and filtering specific columns and rows.Next, we will use SQL's aggregation functions to summarize the data and calculate statistics such as the total population, average growth rate, and literacy rate. We can also group the data by different variables such as state or district to compare the population and growth rates between regions.

Overall, this project will provide valuable insights into the population trends in India and demonstrate how SQL can be used to explore and analyze large datasets.
